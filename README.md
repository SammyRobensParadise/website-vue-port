# Why the move to vue?
I was considering moving my website to `react.js` rather than `vue` but I've chosen `vue` because this way I can keep most of the existing `html` markup as-is, and still get the amazing utilization of component based FE architecture.

# The Plan Under the Hood.
This is a system to re-invent my personal website from the ground up, and will consist of 3 phases. The eventual goal is create a sudo CMS so that content can be easily created without.

## Phase 1
Vue Port: Move Project to Vue

## Phase 2
Create Markdown-to-html service to generate html pages based on a component layout system

## Phase 3
Create GCP cloud instance to handle data update and pipeline to  `gh-pages`
